		I am creating a Plant Microibial fuel cell, and this github page is home to my Arduino code for measuring current, my Autodesk Fusion 360 drawings, and Word documents explaining the project.
	Plant Microbial Fuel Cells work by taking advantage of the up to 70 percent of organic material produced via photosynthesis that canâ€™t be used by the plant. Naturally occurring bacteria around the roots break down this organic residue and release electrons as a waste product. By placing an electrode close to the bacteria to absorb these electrons, one can use the energy stored in the electrons to power an electrical current.  Although the Plant-Microbial Fuel Cell currently only generates 0.4 W per square meter of plant growth  compared with the 200 W produced by one square meter of solar panels in a day, the researchers claim this is more than is generated by fermenting biomass. They also say that future systems could generate as much as 3.2 W per square meter, which would allow a roof measuring 100 m2 to supply electricity to a house with an average consumption of 2,800 kWh a year.
